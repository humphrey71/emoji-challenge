Emoji Kitchen is a creative feature developed by Google that allows users to combine emojis into unique mashups. Here are some key details about Emoji Kitchen:

- **Launch and Functionality**: Initially launched in early 2020 as part of the Gboard app for Android devices, Emoji Kitchen enables users to send merged or elaborated sticker versions of Googleâ€™s emoji designs. As of September 2023, this feature has been integrated into Google search across various devices[3].

- **How It Works**: Users can enter two emojis in a row to generate a combination of those emojis. If the same emoji is entered twice, it often results in an exaggerated version of that emoji. The combinations are based on the words and emojis inputted by the user on eligible messaging or social media platforms[3].

- **Hidden Features**: An update in summer 2021 introduced hidden designs inspired by Googleâ€™s blob emoji set, which was popular from 2013 to 2017. To access these hidden designs, users can add a ðŸª„ Magic Wand or âœ¨ Sparkles emoji before entering another emoji. If the subsequent emoji has a blob design available, it will appear as the first option in the Emoji Kitchen selection area[3].

- **Combination Variety**: According to a Google blog article published on World Emoji Day 2024, there are over 100,000 possible combinations available within Emoji Kitchen[3]. 

- **Usage**: To use Emoji Kitchen, users can visit the official website or use the Gboard app. They can select emojis from a provided interface to create their desired mashup. The process is designed to be fun and allows for significant creativity in digital communication[1][2].

These features make Emoji Kitchen a popular tool for enhancing text-based communication with personalized and expressive emoji combinations.

Here are more original materials regarding "Emoji Kitchen":

- **Functionality and Combinations**: Emoji Kitchen allows users to combine two emojis to create a new sticker. When two emojis are entered, the system generates a mashup based on predefined combinations. For example, combining a "toast" emoji with a "robot" emoji results in a "toaster" emoji. Users can create over 100,000 combinations by mixing different emojis[3][6].

- **Accessing Emoji Kitchen**: Initially exclusive to Android's Gboard, Emoji Kitchen can now be accessed on various platforms, including iOS, Windows, and macOS. Users can access it through Google search by entering "Emoji Kitchen" and clicking the "Get cooking" button. This opens a widget where users can select emojis to combine[3][5].

- **Types of Mashups**: There are five distinct types of emoji mashups recognized within Emoji Kitchen. These include color modifiers, fusion (combining face emojis), juxtaposition (mixing faces with objects), double taps (using the same emoji twice), and conceptual combinations (like merging a star with a fish to create a starfish) [5][6].

- **Creative Process**: Jennifer Daniel, head of design for emoji at Google, explained that Emoji Kitchen is based on an understanding of visual communication. The feature allows for playful combinations that reflect cultural slang and expressions. The combinations are not solely automated; they involve manual curation and creative input from designers at Google[4][6].

- **User Engagement**: Since its launch, users have shared over 3 billion stickers created through Emoji Kitchen. This engagement highlights the popularity and creative potential of the feature in enhancing digital communication[7].

- **Hidden Features**: In summer 2021, hidden designs inspired by Google's earlier blob emoji set were introduced. Users can access these by using a magic wand or sparkles emoji before entering another emoji, which reveals additional options in the selection area[1][6].

These points provide insights into how Emoji Kitchen operates, its features, and its impact on digital communication.
